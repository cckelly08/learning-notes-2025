# IPT Seminar — Ultrafast Lasers
**Date:** 2025-09-12  
**Speaker:** Huang, Po-han  
**Topic:** Ultrafast Lasers – An Enabler for Novel Microsystems with Complex 3D Structures and Advanced Materials

---

## Key Takeaways
- **Ultrafast lasers**: pulse duration on pico- to femtosecond scale → enables non-linear absorption and highly localized material modification.
- **Lithography**: linear absorption vs. **multiphoton absorption** (multiphoton happens only at high intensity, enabling 3D writing).
- **Nanoscale 3D printing with HSQ (Hydrogen silsesquioxane)**:
  - Direct conversion to silica-like structures (durable, stable, transparent).
  - **Post-processing-free**: no high-temperature annealing required; low shrinkage.
  - Achieves **sub-micrometer resolution** with thermal stability comparable to silica glass.
- **Observed phenomena**:
  - Selective generation of **Si nanocrystals**.
  - Formation of **self-organized nanocracks** in HSQ; pattern orientation can be controlled by polarization.
  - **Hierarchical structures**, e.g., rotatable nano-gratings.
- **Applications**: optical resonators (waveguides), optical fiber elements, potential roles in energy storage.

## Questions / Notes
- Photoresist used: **HSQ**.
- Etch method mentioned: **KOH**.
- My reflection: interesting that HSQ can produce silica-like stability without anneal — worth checking microstructure (amorphous vs. crystalline) and optical losses.
