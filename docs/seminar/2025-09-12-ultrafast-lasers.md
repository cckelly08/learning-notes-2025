## 🔑 Key Takeaways
- **Ultrafast lasers**: pulse duration on pico- to femtosecond scale → enables non-linear absorption and highly localized material modification.
- **Lithography**: linear absorption vs. **multiphoton absorption** (multiphoton happens only at high intensity, enabling 3D writing).
- **Nanoscale 3D printing with HSQ (Hydrogen silsesquioxane)**:
  - Direct conversion to silica-like structures (durable, stable, transparent).
  - **Post-processing-free**: no high-temperature annealing required; low shrinkage.
  - Achieves **sub-micrometer resolution** with thermal stability comparable to silica glass.

## 🔬 Observed phenomena
- Selective generation of **Si nanocrystals**.
- Formation of **self-organized nanocracks** in HSQ; pattern orientation controllable by polarization.
- **Hierarchical structures**, e.g., rotatable nano-gratings.

## 💡 Applications
- Optical resonators (waveguides)
- Optical fiber elements
- Potential roles in energy storage

## ❓ Questions / Notes
| Item | Info |
|---|---|
| Photoresist | HSQ |
| Etch method | KOH |
| Reflection | Interesting that HSQ can produce silica-like stability without anneal — worth checking microstructure (amorphous vs. crystalline) and optical losses. |
